Introduction
The Cryptographic Data Management application is a .NET application designed to securely store and manage encrypted data in a SQL Server database. This document provides an overview of the encryption methodology, database schema, and instructions on using the application's user interface.

Encryption Algorithm
The application utilizes the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm for data encryption. AES is a widely adopted symmetric encryption algorithm that ensures confidentiality and security of sensitive information. The application uses AES in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for encryption and decryption, providing authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD).

Database Schema
EncryptedData Table
The primary entity in the application is the EncryptedData table, which stores the encrypted data along with other necessary information.

Column	                  Type	               Description
Id	                  INT	               Auto-incremented primary key.
Data	                  NVARCHAR	       Encrypted data using AES-GCM.
InitializationVector	  VARBINARY	       Binary data required for decryption.
Timestamp	          DATETIME	       Timestamp indicating when the data was added.

Using the User Interface
1. Add Encrypted Data
To add encrypted data:

Launch the application.
Navigate to the "Add Data" section.
Enter the plaintext data in the input field.
Click the "Encrypt and Save" button.
The application will encrypt the provided data using AES-GCM and store it in the database.

2. View Encrypted Data
To view encrypted data:

Navigate to the "View Data" section.
The application will display a list of encrypted data entries.
Click on a specific entry to view details, including the decrypted data.
3. Decrypt Data
To decrypt data:

Navigate to the "View Data" section.
Click on a specific entry.
The application will prompt for the decryption key.
Enter the correct key and click "Decrypt."
The decrypted data will be displayed, ensuring secure access to the original information.

4. Update or Delete Data
To update or delete encrypted data:

Navigate to the "View Data" section.
Click on a specific entry.
Choose the "Update" or "Delete" option.
Follow the prompts to make the desired changes.
